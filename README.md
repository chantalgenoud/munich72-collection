Technical Issues
    -Clone and adapt the repository. Problem: There was a code missing in the manual, due to someone in another team, who cut it, instead of copy it. Solution: Coaching with Anita and setting it up. She made the manuel then in read-only to protect it from further failures.

    -MVD. Blade, Routes, Controller. Issue: It doesn't work accordingy. Problem: The blade.php had errors, the bootstrap was missing in the head. The HTML was not clean. Solution: Double check it and ask Chris to help.
    Amazing. 

    -Padding and Margins in images

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
